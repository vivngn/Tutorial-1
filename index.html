                        <p id="ctoppara">Sebastian Michaelis is the antihero in the manga and anime series Kuroshitsuji. He is the butler of the Phantomhive household and acts as Ciel's bodyguard, two jobs he is completely devoted to. Sebastian often describes himself through the phrase "I am simply one hell of a butler" (わたしはあくまで執事ですから, Watashi wa akumade shitsuji desu kara). The phrase plays on the word "demon" (あくま, akuma) and the phrase "to the end" (あくまで, akumade). It can also translate to "I am a demon and a butler". He is highly skilled in any area and handles every task, no matter how impossible it is as well as any problem that arises from the errors of the other staff with ease, stating it is only natural as the butler to the Phantomhive family. This is due to the fact he is a demon bound by a Faustian contract to abide by Ciel's will. A sign similar to the one marking Ciel's right eye can be found on Sebastian's left hand, which has been used on one occasion to twist the arm of a kidnapper without touching him.</p>
